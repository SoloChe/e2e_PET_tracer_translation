# End-to-end Unpaired Florbetapir (FBP) and Pittsburgh Compound B (PiB) Tracer Harmonization (FBP -> PiB) 

Paper is in preparation.

## Description
We developed a modified Cycle-GAN model to harmonize unpaired FBP and PET tracer data, specifically for FBP to PiB (Pittsburgh compound B) conversion. More details such as training data (private) and further optimization will be provided in the future.

- `pipeline`: model deployment and inference
- `testing_deploy.ipynb`: notebook for testing the model deployment
- `train_local`: local model training, `bash training_run_local.sh` 
- `local_testing`: local deployment testing. 
- `CICD`: CI/CD (optional) for model deployment.
